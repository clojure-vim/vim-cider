DOCUMENTATION                                   *cider-documentation*

                                                *cider-no-maps*
g:cider_no_maps         Set this option to true to disable built-in maps.

                                                *refactor-nrepl-options*
g:refactor_nrepl_options
                        Use this option to set settings for refactor-nrepl.
                        Check https://github.com/clojure-emacs/refactor-nrepl#configure
                        for documentation.

                                                *cider-cf*
cf{motion}              Format the code indicated by {motion}.
                        Use <Plug>CiderFormat to map this yourself.
                        Visual mode mapping is not by default enabled but you
                        can do that yourself:
>
                        autocmd FileType clojure xmap f <Plug>CiderFormat
<
                        Just remeber to use mapping which doesn't conflict
                        with e.g. change command.

                                                *cider-cff*
cff                     Format the innertmost form at the cursor.
                        Like |fireplace-c!|
                        Use <Plug>CiderFormatCount to map this yourself.

                                                *cider-cF*
cF                      Format the current file.
                        Use ggcfG to map this yourself (notice to use your own
                        |cider-cf| mapping.)
